# Vue_React_Django

First start after cloning the repository.

We run `docker-compose up` (version 1.27) and wait for the containers to start.

Once we start we enter the django container and carry out the migrations
`python3 manage.py migrate`

We create a superuser
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

Then we will have to create a category from Postman
API: `"localhost:8000/api/fitness/category"`

```
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
