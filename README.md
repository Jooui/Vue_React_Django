## Getting Started

For run the code on your local machine and be able to observe the latest changes you need to install Docker/Docker-Compose.

## Prerequisites

You must have **docker** and **docker-compose** installed on your machine. For install docker correctly, realize the following steps:

[How to install docker (Official Website)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Next, you must have a specific version of docker-compose, since the previous ones contain a bug that does not allow the correct operation of the app. Realize the following steps:

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
```
sudo docker-compose --version
```

## Installation

We run `docker-compose up` (version 1.27) and wait for the containers to start.

Once we start we enter the django container and carry out the migrations
`python3 manage.py migrate`

We create a superuser
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

Then we will have to create a category from Postman
API: `"localhost:8000/api/fitness/category"`

``` 
{
  "name": "Chest",
  "image": "https://www.deportesaludable.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pecho.jpg"
} 
```
